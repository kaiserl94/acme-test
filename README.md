- Feel free to make as many additional components as you feel necessary for your design. 
- Organize them as you feel is best


In terms of styling, you can extend off of the current styles in `styles/main.scss`

- Feel free to use plain css inside of `main.scss`
- Organize your scss as you feel is best
- Add any additional scss files inside of the `styles` folder

**NOTE: make sure they are included in `main.scss` as this is the main file which gets loaded by the application.**
